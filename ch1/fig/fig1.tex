         be as few or as many panels as you'd like. All figures 
         will be numbered Chapter.Section and will be refered to
         as such using the ``label--reference'' system. Additionally,
         there is no need for figures to be on separate pages in
         a Dartmouth thesis, it's up to the author.}
